🕹️ PacMan Adventure 🕹️
Welcome to the PacMan Adventure project! 🎉 In this exciting escapade, we tamed the wild PacMan and made it dance across your screen. Let's dive into the fun details:

Challenge Highlights 🚀
Interval Interlude ⏰
The thrill begins with the mighty setInterval() method, making PacMan boogie to the beat by calling the Run() function every 300 milliseconds. Miss this step, and PacMan might decide to sit out the dance party.

Direction Dilemma 🔄
In the PacMan universe, choosing the right path is crucial. The checkPageBounds() function got an upgrade to decide when PacMan should switch directions. It's the GPS for our digital hero.

Edge Excitement 🔄
PacMan knows how to handle the edges with style. We made sure it pirouettes gracefully when it taps the screen edges, especially when it sways left. Coordination is key!
